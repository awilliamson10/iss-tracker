The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-nation construction project that is the largest single structure humans ever put into space. The space station flies at an average altitude of 248 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth. It circles the globe every 90 minutes at a speed of about 17,500 mph (28,000 km/h). In one day, the station travels about the distance it would take to go from Earth to the moon and back. [Source](https://www.space.com/16748-international-space-station.html)

As the 3rd brightest object in the sky I always loved running outside to watch the space station quickly zoom past my home. However, its quick speed required an absolute knowledge of when the ISS would be directly passing into my view. Therefore, it became necessary to utilize tools that track the position of the space station to provide me with the window of time I could witness this mesmerizing habituale satellite. 

I've developed a similar tool here using React and JavaScript libraries such as Satellite.js and Three.js. This is a real-time rendering model of the ISS as it rotates around earth as calculated by the two-line element set (TLE).
